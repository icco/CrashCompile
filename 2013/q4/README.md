# Robot Travels

A robot is wandering around Hacker Dojo, and records its position every second. Assuming that the robot moves in a straight line between position measurements, write a program that computes how far the robot has traveled.

The input will be a series of lines with two comma-separated floating-point values, representing the X and Y coordinates of the robot at each position. The output will be a the total distance the robot has traveled, rounded to three decimal places.

## Sample Input

```
3.45,1.2
4.45,0.2
```

## Sample Output
